## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   That images can be difficult to handle, I also used `<svg>` element for the first time and learned to download it from a website like 'font-awesome'.

### Continued development

-   I faced some difficulty while doing the background image in desktop layout, so I will learn and tinker with the `background` related properties of css.

### Useful resources

-   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/?o=r) - I downloaded the facebook, twitter and instagram's svgs from this website.
